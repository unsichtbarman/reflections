When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I guess when you are working with other people. Also when you are using more than one machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You probably want to have control over when you send changes to the remote repository, much as you want control over your local repository.
